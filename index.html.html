		<h1>A Fine Digital Line</h1>
		<h2>by Jacob Toney</h2>
		<p>In our digital world, interactive television and digital games have become a staple of a child’s development. With this development a new question of ethics; how much information can companies be allowed to poach from them? Kids, who often don’t fully understand what happens when they share personal details, are increasingly engaging with interactive content. Often times revealing information about themselves or even their parents in ways they don’t realize without knowing the potential risks.</p>
		<p>One of the key regulations designed to protect children in these online spaces is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). COPPA is a U.S. federal law that makes it illegal for companies to collect personal data from kids under the age of 13 without parental consent. The idea is to keep children's information—whether it's their names, addresses, or even what they’re interested in—private and safe from companies that might want to use it for targeted advertising or other profit-driven activities. However, things get tricky when we talk about more modern and interactive content like games on TV. For instance, a game might ask a child to answer questions that seem harmless but can be used to determine their household’s buying habits and preferences to the ends of figuring out how to best sell whatever they can to the child. Many experts, like those from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), argue that this kind of data collection is problematic because children are not able to give meaningful consent, especially when they don’t fully understand the implications. There’s also the issue of companies encouraging kids to share information indirectly. Say a child is playing a game that asks what kinds of products they have laying around the house, or what they most truly desire. Technology designed to distract children is often designed to make them most comfortable, so they will have no problem sharing their inner most thoughts. This data is incredibly valuable to advertisers and marketers, but the child may not realize that they’re giving away family information, not just playing a game.</p>
		<p>Ethically, it’s a slippery slope. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) notes that digital platforms should prioritize a child’s safety and development, but the reality is often different. Companies are focused on profits and can use collected data to influence kids’ behavior, pushing them towards in-game purchases or even affecting their parents' buying decisions through targeted ads. From a development standpoint, data collection can have long-term effects on how kids perceive privacy and autonomy. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) warns that the constant engagement with digital content can interfere with a child’s social skills and mental well-being. If companies are collecting children’s data to keep them hooked on their games or to advertise more products, it could worsen issues like screen addiction or social isolation.
So, what can be done? It’s clear that stricter rules need to be put in place to protect kids. COPPA is a good start, but it needs to be updated for the digital age, where interactive TV and games blur the lines between entertainment and advertising. Parents should also be fully informed when companies ask for any kind of data from their kids, and there should be strong limits on what data can be collected in the first place—especially information about families' buying habits or personal details.</p>
		<p>In conclusion, while interactive media offers new and exciting ways for kids to engage with content, the collection of their personal data—especially without clear consent and understanding—raises serious ethical concerns. Companies should prioritize children's well-being over profit and be held accountable when they cross the line. After all, kids should be able to play and learn in digital spaces without sacrificing their privacy or unknowingly giving away compromising information.</p>
